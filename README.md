# Introduction

You are required to create a C++ program that interactively accepts and stores the information of used handphones for sale as shown in the table below. 

```
Model		Make	Price	Condition
------		-----	---	--------
Samsung		S2	500	B
Apple		Iphone5	580	B
Apple		Iphone6	1200	A
Samsung		Note10	4000	A
```

Declare an array of 5 structures named Handphones in your program. 
Using the data type declared in your program:

1. Write a function named storeInfo() that passes as an argument, an array of structure to capture the information of each car entered by the user. 
2. In the same program, create a function named sortInfo() to sort the info based on the price of the handphones. Your array of structure should be accessed using pointer variables. 
3. Write a function call displayInfo(), to display the information keyed in.

# Example Code
The sample code is given in a file called [phones.cpp](phones.cpp).
There is a logical errors with the code, which makes the sorting work incorrectly, figure it out.
